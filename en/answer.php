                      For leather products, such as nappa, floater, croco, lizard, firenze, etc. It is advisable to protect it with colorless silicones (the polishing of aerosol furniture is a good option). You should never apply the silicone directly on the material, before it should be applied on a dry cloth and this on the product. Never wash in a washing machine or store the product in humid places.</p>

                      It is advisable to wipe with a dry cloth to remove excess dust and then place colorless waxes to protect leather from footwear. Avoid storing both shoes in the same bag or box, because, due to the use, the sole can with dust and mistreat the material, especially in suede materials.</p>
